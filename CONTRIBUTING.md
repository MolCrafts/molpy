# Contributing to MolPy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MolPy!

The full contributor handbook lives in the documentation — this file is just the
entry point, so the rules have a single home and cannot drift:

- **[Development Setup](https://docs.molcrafts.org/molpy/developer/development-setup/)** — clone, editable install, pre-commit hooks, running tests
- **[Contributing Workflow](https://docs.molcrafts.org/molpy/developer/contributing/)** — branches, conventional commits, the PR checklist
- **[Coding Style](https://docs.molcrafts.org/molpy/developer/coding-style/)** — ruff formatting, type hints, Google-style docstrings, the mutation contract
- **[Testing](https://docs.molcrafts.org/molpy/developer/testing/)** — pytest conventions, markers, coverage expectations
- **[Architecture Overview](https://docs.molcrafts.org/molpy/developer/architecture-overview/)** — module map and extension points, read before larger changes
