    "# Core Concepts in molpy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore the foundational concepts that underpin the molpy library. Understanding these core ideas will help you effectively utilize and extend molpy for your molecular modeling needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Entity: The Fundamental Building Block\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Entity`** is the base class for all structural elements in molpy. It's essentially a dictionary with identity-based hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inherits from `UserDict` - behaves like a dictionary\n",
    "- Identity-based hashing - each entity is unique by identity, not content\n",
    "- Minimal design - no IDs, no persistence, no global context\n",
    "- Stores arbitrary key-value pairs in `.data`\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Subclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create custom entities when you need domain-specific structural elements:\n",
    "- Atoms, residues, molecules, crystals\n",
    "- Coarse-grained beads\n",
    "- Virtual sites, dummy atoms"

    "- Add temporary behavior without modifying base classes\n",
    "- Implement design patterns (decorator, adapter, etc.)\n",
    "- Create composable transformations\n",
