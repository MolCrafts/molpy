# Concepts

MolPy employs distinct representations at each stage of a modeling workflow. This section explains that design from the editable molecular graph to the numerical frame representation, and covers the auxiliary structures — periodic geometry, force-field parameters, time-ordered sequences, file-format boundaries, packaged workflows, and engine integration — that complete the data model.

These pages are self-contained and may be read in any order by readers already familiar with one or more concepts. New users are advised to proceed from the first page to the last.


## Representational Hierarchy

The diagram below illustrates the standard data flow through a MolPy pipeline. Each node represents a core data structure; each edge represents an explicit transformation.

**`Atomistic`** is the primary editing surface. Atom addition and removal, bond formation, reaction execution, and polymer assembly all operate on this structure.

**`Frame`** is the primary numerical surface. Vectorized distance computation, file I/O, and engine export all operate on `Frame` objects and their constituent `Block` tables.

**`ForceField`** is an independent data structure that travels alongside a molecular system. Force field parameters are neither embedded in atoms nor derived implicitly; they are stored in a queryable typed dictionary.

**`Box`** specifies the periodic simulation cell and attaches to a `Frame` as a first-class attribute, not as metadata.

**`Trajectory`** is a time-ordered sequence of `Frame` objects providing lazy access patterns for large datasets.
