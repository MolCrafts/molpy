    "This is the first question every user has. In computational chemistry, we rarely want to build molecules atom-by-atom (e.g., `atom.add(x=1, y=0, z=0)`). Instead, we use **Line Notations**—compact string schemas that describe chemical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "MolPy is designed to work seamlessly with modern string formats that go beyond standard chemistry. We support four distinct languages, each serving a specific purpose in the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **SMILES**: For defining exact, specific molecules (\"I want Ethanol\").\n",
    "2.  **SMARTS**: For defining abstract patterns (\"I want to find all alcohol groups\").\n",
    "3.  **BigSMILES**: For defining stochastic building blocks (\"I want a Polystyrene monomer with reactive ends\").\n",
    "4. **G-BigSMILES**: For defining polymer systems with distributions (\"I want polystyrene systems drawn from this distribution\").\n",
    "5.  **CGSmiles**: For defining high-level topology (\"I want a block copolymer with Graph A connected to Graph B\").\n",
