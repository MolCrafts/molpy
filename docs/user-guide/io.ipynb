    "Access chemical files with molpy is straightforward. There several types of chemfiles. The files only contains one frame of simulation data (atoms, box, maybe little bit of forcefield parameters) we call them **data**. The files with multiple frames are **trajectories**. Also, some files contain **Forcefield** parameters, **logs** data.\n",
