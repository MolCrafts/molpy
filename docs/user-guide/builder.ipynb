    "The `linear()` function automates the polymerization workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validation** – Checks that all sequence labels exist in your library\n",

    "- Situations where you need explicit control over connection chemistry\n",

    "## 2. Packing Molecules into a Box\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a molecule (from building, reactions, or file input), you often need to create a simulation-ready system with many copies distributed in a box. The `molpy.pack` module handles this using external optimization engines like **Packmol**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why packing matters:**\n",
    "- Solvation: surround your molecule with water or organic solvent\n",
    "- Bulk systems: create liquids, polymer melts, or mixed-phase systems\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's what happens under the hood:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Template definition** – You provide one or more molecular `Frame` objects\n",
    "2. **Target specification** – You define how many copies and where to place them (via constraints)\n",
    "3. **File generation** – `Molpack` writes intermediate structure files for the packer backend\n",
    "4. **Optimization** – The backend (Packmol) finds a non-overlapping configuration\n",
    "5. **Result parsing** – You get back a packed `Frame` ready for simulation or file I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter choices explained:**\n",
    "- `number=100` – balances simulation size with computational cost. Fewer molecules run faster but may not capture bulk behavior.\n",
    "- `box_size=20.0` – should be large enough to accommodate all molecules without excessive density. Check the target density for your system.\n",
    "- `max_steps=1000` – more steps improve packing quality but take longer. Start with 1000 and increase if you see overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use packing:**\n",
    "- Creating solvent boxes around a solute\n",
    "- Building bulk liquid or amorphous systems\n",
    "- Initializing mixed-component systems (e.g., polymer + plasticizer)\n",
    "\n",
    "For finer control, you can use the lower-level `Packer` classes directly or write custom packer implementations.\n",

    "## 3. From Building to Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to build and pack, let's see how these pieces fit into a typical molecular simulation workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Pipeline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build** – Use `builder` (and sometimes `reacter`) to create molecular structures as `Atomistic` objects\n",
    "2. **Convert** – Transform to `Frame` + `Box` representation (needed for I/O and simulation engines)\n",
    "3. **Pack** – Use `molpy.pack` to create a simulation-ready multi-molecule system\n",
    "4. **Assign force field** – Type atoms and assign parameters (see `user-guide/typifier.ipynb`)\n",
    "5. **Export** – Write LAMMPS/OpenMM/GROMACS input files (see `user-guide/io.ipynb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data structures at each stage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Building & chemistry**: `Atomistic` + wrappers (`Monomer`, `Polymer`)  \n",
    "  *Why*: Graph-based representation makes bond manipulation and reaction tracking easy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial packing**: `Frame` + `Box`  \n",
    "  *Why*: Array-based structure is efficient for geometric operations and file I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation**: `Frame` + force field + engine-specific writers  \n",
    "  *Why*: Simulation engines expect structured text/binary formats with coordinates and force field parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation of concerns keeps your code modular and makes it easy to swap components (different builders, packers, or export formats) without rewriting everything.\n"
