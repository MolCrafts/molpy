    "# Molecular Packing\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pack` module distributes molecules spatially into simulation boxes without overlaps. This is essential for creating properly initialized molecular dynamics systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why packing matters:**\n",
    "- Simulations need realistic starting configurations (no atom overlaps)\n",
    "- Target densities must be achieved (too loose = unrealistic, too dense = high energy)\n",
    "- Multi-component systems need controlled composition (e.g., 80% solvent, 20% solute)\n",
    "\n",
    "**KEY**: For detailed examples, see [`user-guide/builder.ipynb`](builder.ipynb) which covers packing as part of the building workflow. This page focuses on the underlying packing API.\n",

    "- **Molpack** – Main packing interface (coordinates external packers)\n",
